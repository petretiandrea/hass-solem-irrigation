# Quality Scale review

The Quality Scale guides implementation and review. No official tier is claimed
for this custom integration. `custom_components/solem_woobee/quality_scale.yaml`
tracks every rule with evidence, pending work or an explicit exemption reason.
Do not mark a rule done solely because a base class exists or tests pass.

## SBR-92 corrections

| Finding | Resolution and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Missing duration made the entire zone unavailable | Zone availability inherits CoordinatorEntity. `remaining_seconds` preserves None; tests distinguish missing data from zero and connection failure. Final platform state properties must preserve None. |
| Synthetic listener polled without consumers | Removed. EntityComponent lifecycle test verifies no timer polling before subscription, polling while subscribed, stopping after removal and successful unload. |
| README described the pre-coordinator skeleton | Updated polling behavior, scope and removal instructions. |
| Coverage had no gate | CI reports line/branch coverage and requires >95% for each HA adapter module, including entity.py and config flow. |

## Remaining acceptance work

Bronze is not claimed: branding and dependency provenance remain to be reviewed,
and actual platform IDs/names must be verified in SBR-93/SBR-94. The embedded
client is an intentional custom-integration architecture decision, not a claimed
exemption from Core distribution requirements.

Silver is not claimed: the HA adapter coverage gate excludes `woobee_api`, whose
unit tests run separately. The whole-integration coverage requirement remains
TODO until every embedded module is assessed along with the final platforms.
Log transition assertions, platform parallelism and command errors are also
pending. Fixed-key BLE has no user credentials or reauthentication flow; that
exemption is documented rather than inventing a cloud login.

Gold/Platinum work (diagnostics, verified discovery, entity metadata/translations,
strict typing and further documentation) remains visible in the checklist.
Five-minute polling is a documented conservative choice, not a measured battery
or BLE limit. Hardware tests are still needed for battery impact and freshness.

## Validation

Use the project's Python 3.14 environment:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m pytest tests/integration -q --cov=custom_components.solem_woobee --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=json
python scripts/check_ha_coverage.py
python -m compileall -q custom_components scripts tests
```

CI runs integration checks against HA 2026.8.0 and 2026.10.4. Every future platform
must extend lifecycle/state tests and update this checklist with evidence.
